ASP.NET Core 6 CRUD Operations With Search Box




It is a typical CRUD Operation App with Search Box to filter data.


In that programm I use ASP.NET Core 6 to Read, Delete, Update and Create to a database.

I use Entity Framework Core 6 for the Migration.

I also use MVC Controller with views, using Entity Framework to show how .NET helps Developers to produce a project real fast.

At the index page there is a search box where we can filter our data.
